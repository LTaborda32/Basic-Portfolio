        <p>Hi! I'm Luis and suck at writting interesting things about myself. which isn't to say im not interesting, heres a list of my hobbies: </p>
    <h3>My interest</h3>
        <ul>    
            <li>Die hard anime fan</li>
            <li>Amateur photographer</li>
            <li>reading comics (mostly spider-man) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I was also a medical biller for three years, became certified but could not stand the long hours with no job satisfaction! In a bit of an impolsive move
            I quit my job as a medical biller to do data entry (which is not as  high maintance) and joined a bootcamp in order to pursue a career i know i'd love. So now here 
            I am, just trying my best I guess.
        </p>
